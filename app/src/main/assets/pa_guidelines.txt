In general, the NHS recommends that you complete 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity exercise, or a combination of both, per week. You can think of one minute of vigorous activity as being equivalent to two minutes of moderate activity. It is best to work towards these guidelines gradually, particularly if you are struggling with your knees. Try to add an extra few minutes of activity into your routine each week. My KOALA recommends activity goals which are personalised to you, taking into account your recent activity and symptom scores.

You should also try to get up and walk about regularly if you are spending a long time sitting down. Even if you do lots of exercise, long periods of sitting can be bad for your health. You can set a goal for non-sedentary hours on the Update Goals page.
