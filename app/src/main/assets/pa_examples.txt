Exercise can help with your knee symptoms so you should try to stay active, but take care not to overdo it as this may make your knees more painful. 

Examples of moderate intensity activities include walking at a brisk pace, a game of doubles tennis and mowing the lawn. You may like to try water-based activities such as swimming (moderate to vigorous, depending on speed) and water aerobics (moderate intensity) which can be easier on your knees. 

Running, fast cycling and football usually count as vigorous intensity activity. You can find more examples at the NHS website in the links below.
